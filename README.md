This tool is a graphical browser for Hypermedia API based on Collection+JSON

Collection+JSON is a JSON-based read/write hypermedia-type designed to support management and querying of simple collections. It is similar to the The Atom Syndication Format (RFC4287) and the The Atom Publishing Protocol (RFC5023) . However, Collection+JSON defines both the format and the semantics in a single media type. It also includes support for Query Templates and expanded write support through the use of a Write Template.
