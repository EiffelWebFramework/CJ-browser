CONNEG is a library that provides utilities to select the best repesentation of a resource for a client
where there are multiple representations available.

Using this labrary you can retrieve the best Variant for media type, language preference, enconding and compression.
The library is based on eMIME Eiffel MIME library based on Joe Gregorio code

Take into account that the library is under development so is expected that the API change.

The library contains utilities that deal with content negotiation (server driven negotiation).This utility class
is based on ideas taken from the Book Restful WebServices Cookbook

The class CONNEG_SERVER_SIDE contains several features that helps to write different type of negotiations (media type, language,
charset and compression).
So for each of the following questions, you will have a corresponding method to help in the solution.

-  How to implement Media type negotiation?
	Hint: Use CONNEG_SERVER_SIDE.media_type_preference

-  How to implement Language Negotiation?
	Hint: Use CONNEG_SERVER_SIDE.language_preference

-  How to implement Character encoding Negotiation?
	Hint: Use CONNEG_SERVER_SIDE.charset_preference

-  How to implement Compression Negotiation?
	Hint: Use CONNEG_SERVER_SIDE.encoding_preference

There is also a  [test case](test/conneg_server_side_test.e "conneg_server_side_test") where you can check how to use this class.

			Server-driven Negotiation :	If the selection of the best representation for a response is made by an algorithm located at the server,
			it is called server-driven negotiation. Selection is based on the available representations of the response (the dimensions over which it can vary; e.g. language, content-coding, etc.)
			and the contents of particular header fields in the request message or on other information pertaining to the request (such as the network address of the client).
			Server-driven negotiation is advantageous when the algorithm for selecting from among the available representations is difficult to describe to the user agent,
			or when the server desires to send its "best guess" to the client along with the first response (hoping to avoid the round-trip delay of a subsequent request if the "best guess" is good enough for the user).
			In order to improve the server's guess, the user agent MAY include request header fields (Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, etc.) which describe its preferences for such a response.
